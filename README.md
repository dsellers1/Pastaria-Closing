At work, I have three cash register drawers that get counted at the end of the night. It is logged on paper and submitted to the boss. He tracks everything. I have started making an app that will allow us to submit the data electronically in hopes that we can slowly move to an electronic system that will make things easier and quicker for everyone. I watched some videos on YouTube and decided to use JavaScript along with jQuery for the programming. I used Adobe’s PhoneGap to build the app for me.<br>
<br>
Here are my requirements:<br>
I must be able to input 14 pieces of data for each of the cash drawers. <br>
Some math happens which reports if the drawer is in compliance and then specifies how much money is put in the safe and how much stays in the drawer (8 more pieces of data for each drawer). Then there are totals for the day which is another 3 pieces of data. (14+8)*3 + 3 = 69 data points. (Ugh. Just did the math for the first time. Did not realize it was that much…)<br>
The data is then stored in a file somewhere (locally or OneDrive?) for printing and further tracking and analytics.<br>
Future tracking and analytical reports through Excel or Grafana (or something that I can make pretty graphs and tables).<br>
<br>
Problems:<br>
I do not know how to program with JavaScript. Have a workable knowledge of Visual Basic for Applications (Excel).<br>
With so many input boxes, I have the program for one kind of working but I don’t know how to easily adapt the code to incorporate three drawers and be able to output information to the screen and data to a file. I am sure I need to be able to use a function, but I have never “sent” that many parameters.<br>
Not sure how I am going to get the information printed.<br>
Not sure how I am going to get the data saved: CSV, Excel, some sort of database?<br>
